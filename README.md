Note:

Apologies in advance if the code in this repository
is a complete mess.

The code in this repository has been cleaned up to remove
as much pre-processing of data files as possible.

The RandomForest implementation builds under 0.12. It may
have some bugs related to how domains are utilized.

If there are outstanding issues related to the clean up
please post the issues to github.
